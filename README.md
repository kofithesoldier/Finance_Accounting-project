Practice SQL from basic to advanced using a realistic accounting and finance dataset with customers, invoices, payments, budgets, and analytics-ready KPIs.

# SQL Practice Project – Accounting & Finance Dataset

## Overview

This project provides a comprehensive SQL practice environment for learners aiming to develop their skills from basic to advanced SQL in accounting and finance. It includes a realistic multi-table dataset with customers, employees, vendors, invoices, payments, budgets, and expenses.

# Dataset Creation

The dataset was manually created to reflect common accounting and finance scenarios. It contains the following tables:

* **Customers** – CustomerID, CustomerName, Country

* **Employees** – EmployeeID, Name, Department, Position, HireDate, Salary

* **Vendors** – VendorID, VendorName, Country, Category

* **Invoices** – InvoiceID, CustomerID, VendorID, InvoiceDate, TotalAmount, Status

* **Payments** – PaymentID, InvoiceID, PaymentDate, Amount

* **Expenses** – ExpenseID, Category, Amount, ExpenseDate

* **Budgets** – Department, Year, BudgetAmount, ActualSpent

The data was generated with realistic values to allow meaningful SQL analysis and KPI calculations.
